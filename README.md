[Try Benkyou Here](https://benkyou.vercel.app/)

Benkyou is a mobile-friendly Pomodoro timer & to-do list web app made for 
students to improve focus and reward productivity.

Benkyou is currently in development, there are still a few or several things that
I'd like to add and optimise.

## Features:

* Timer - 3 options: Pomodoro session (25min), Short break (5min), Long break (15min).
* To-do list - Write down what needs to be done during the study session.
* Dark mode - For late night studying.
* Mobile friendly - Use Benkyo on the go. 


## To be done:

* Make the timer more accurate.
* Save user's tasks locally.
* Automatically switch to the right timer when a session is completed. E.g 1 Pomodoro session -> 1 Short break
* Improve browser notifications
* Improve send button animations
* Improve timer select
* Change bin emoji to bin icon
* Add about page
